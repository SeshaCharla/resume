\section*{\underline{Control Systems Design Experience Summary}}
\begin{itemize}
        \item 8+ years of research and industry experience in control design, system identification, and estimation across automotive, aerospace, and industrial applications.
        \item PhD research focuses on Set-membership and Adaptive Robust Control for estimation, fault diagnostics, and control of nonlinear systems under uncertainties (diesel engine after-treatment systems, multirotor actuators).
        \item 2+ years experience training undergraduate and graduate students in control and estimation algorithms on embedded systems (STM32, NI-MyRio) for electromechanical systems.
\end{itemize}

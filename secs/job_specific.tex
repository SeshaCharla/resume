\section*{\underline{Control Systems Design Experience Summary}}
\begin{itemize}
        \item Over 8 years of research and industry experience in developing Control design and estimation based solutions for systems spanning across automotive, aerospace, and industrial applications.
        \item Core of my PhD research involves developing and implementing novel Set-membership and Adaptive robust control based methods for control, estimation and fault diagnostics of nonlinear systems under uncertainties. Specifically diesel engine after-treatment systems and multirotor actuators.
        \item 2 years of experience training undergraduate and graduate students in design and implementation of control and estimation algorithms for electromechanical systems, including refrigeration, heat transfer, and nonlinear rigid body systems.
\end{itemize}

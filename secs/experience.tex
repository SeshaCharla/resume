\noindent\textit{Research Engineer  - Estimation and Control Systems} (Internship)

\textbf{SC Solutions} - Portland, Oregon \hfill $May, 2023 - August, 2023$

\begin{itemize}
    \item Worked on a USDA funded project for computer vision based fat estimation in meat. Formulated an auto-regressive estimation model and, state and parameter estimation algorithms using vision data.
    \item Developed OpenCV based computer vision software in C++, for real-time implementation and benchmarking of estimation algorithms on large video datasets.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textit{Motion Control Engineer } (Internship)

\textbf{Virgin Hyperloop} - Los Angeles, California \hfill $June, 2022  - August, 2022$

\begin{itemize}
        \item Designed and demonstrated supervisory control for minimizing the force mismatch across the bogie which
        improved the EM engine efficiency based on the requirements worked out during the cross team meetings.
        \item Refined the control architecture for single EM engine control and demonstrated the limitation of the linear design on the non-linear system in MATLAB using the full Simulink model developed in house.
        \item Created a MIMO model for the guidance bogie engine assembly for robust control and worked out the stability of off-diagonal
        elements w.r.t suspension parameters.
\end{itemize}

\noindent\textit{Scientist/Engineer 'SC', Test Instrumentation and Controls, Thermal Systems Group} (Full-time role)

\textbf{Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)} - Bengaluru, India \hfill $July, 2016 - July, 2019$

\begin{itemize}
        \item Responsible for thermal instrumentation and control for thermal-vacuum and thermal-balance tests of 15 satellite systems over the course of 3 years including \textit{Chandrayan-2} (the lunar lander project of ISRO) mission's orbiter, lander and rover.
        \item Developed a python software interfacing with the existing \textit{SCADA} systems for simultaneous testing of multiple satellites, doubling the productivity of test systems and enabling simultaneous testing in Chandrayan-2 mission.
	\item Implemented an optimal heater design software with a web based front-end in python that streamlined PI gain tuning, in-situ heater sensor mapping that completely avoided heater burnout and faults due heater saturation.
\end{itemize}

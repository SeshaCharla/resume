\noindent \itbf{Diesel Engine Aftertreatment System Diagnostics} \hfill $August, 2023 - $ Ongoing
\begin{itemize}
        \item Developed a discrete nonlinear hybrid model for $NO_x$ process dynamics in SCR-ASC systems; validated with test-cell \& truck data.
        \item Formulated an aging diagnostics framework using set-membership filtering \& parameter detection.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \itbf{Actuator Fault diagnosis and robust control in Multi-rotors} \hfill $August, 2021 - $ Ongoing
\begin{itemize}
        \item Designed an RPM measurement system using back-EMF commutation signals (MECC'22) and developed a nonlinear model considering the ESC dynamics (ACC'24).
        \item Implemented Adaptive Robust Control for uncertainty rejection \& fault-tolerant RPM tracking (MECC'24).
        \item Created a set-membership filtering \& adaptive control-based fault-diagnostics framework.

\noindent \itbf{Instructor/TA for Control Lab Courses} \hfill $August, 2020 - May, 2023$
\begin{itemize}
<<<<<<< HEAD
        \item Taught C, Assembly, and LabView programming for closed-loop control of mechanical systems (e.g., inverted pendulum, DC motors, thermal systems).

        \item \itbf{Course Development:} Developed coursework on parameter estimation \& robust control for a refrigeration system (ME 586) using STM32 Discovery board.
=======
        \item Assisted students in writing C, Assembly and LabView programs, and their debugging for developing closed loop control for mechanical systems such as inverted pendulum, DC motor and, heating and cooling systems using STM32 or NI-MyRio.

        \item \itbf{Course Development:} Demonstrated parameter estimation and robust control implementation procedures for refrigeration system with variable speed compressor and flow control valve (non-minimum phase system) using STM32 Discovery board as possible guided final project for the future course offerings of ME 586.

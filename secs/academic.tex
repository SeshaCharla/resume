\noindent \itbf{Diesel Engine Aftertreatment System Diagnostics} \hfill $August, 2023 - $ Ongoing
\begin{itemize}
        \item Created a Discrete nonlinear hybrid model for $NO_x$ process dynamics in diesel engine SCR-ASC system that captures the time-evolution of the measurement signals and catalyst saturation for aging detection through parameter changes. Validated the model using real-world test-cell and truck data.
        \item Developed a framework for aging diagnostics using set-membership filtering and parameter change detection.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \itbf{Actuator Fault diagnosis and robust control in Multi-rotors} \hfill $August, 2021 - $ Ongoing
\begin{itemize}
        \item Developed an RPM measurement system using the back-emf commutation signals (MECC'22), formulated and identified nonlinear model that accommodates the input uncertainties due to unknown high-frequency filters inside the ESC (ACC'24) and demonstrated the effectiveness of Adaptive Robust Control for uncertainty rejection and RPM tracking under parameter fluctuations and faults (MECC'24).
        \item Developed a framework for fault-diagnostics and reconfiguration using Set-membership filtering and adaptive robust control.
\end{itemize}
